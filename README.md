graphml4j
=========

A simple Java API for generating [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) files for [yEd](http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/).

When one needs to visualize a graph (for instance a graph of dependencies), [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) is the usual easy-to-use solution. 

A more powerful and interactive solution consists in using a tool like yEd to dynamically layout the graph. yEd provide several layout algorithms out of the box (Hierarchical, Organic, Orthogonal, Circular, etc) to render a graph.
